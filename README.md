# Discrete Empirical Interpolation (DEIM)

This code implements the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM). DEIM is a numerical approximation technique used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data by selecting a smaller set of basis functions that accurately represent the data.

## Introduction

The DEIM algorithm implemented in this code takes a given input dataset and performs the following steps:

1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): The input dataset is decomposed using SVD to obtain the singular vectors and values.
2. Basis Function Selection: A subset of the singular vectors is selected as basis functions to approximate the dataset.
3. Interpolation Points Identification: The DEIM algorithm identifies specific points in the dataset that are used for interpolation.
4. Interpolation Matrix Construction: An interpolation matrix is constructed using the identified interpolation points.
5. Reduced Order Model: The interpolation matrix is used to construct a reduced-order model that captures the essential features of the input dataset.
